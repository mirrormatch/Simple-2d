# Simple 2d
## A simple framework for working with 2d assets in Unity.

What I hope this will initially provide:

* Static sprites from a texture sheet
* Animated sprites from a texture sheet
* Tilemaps

*This currently requires Unity 3.5, since I'm using text based scenes and meta files.*  However, the code should work equally well in previous 3.x releases
